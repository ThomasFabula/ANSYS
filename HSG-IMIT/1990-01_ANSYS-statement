The FFMU is a research organization consisting of about 70 company members
in the region of Baden-Württemberg, who are working in the field of fine 
and precise machining, sensors/transducers and microelectronics. The FFMU 
is mainly supported by the government and the ministery of science and 
technology (BMFT). The results of our research are mainly for public domain. 
The function of the FFMU is to transfer 'know-how' and technology in their 
research fields to the industry and to their member companies.

The 'Institut für Mikro- und Informationstechnik' of the FFMU have research 
activities on the field of silicon/quartz micromachining, especially micromechanics, 
integrated optics and microelectronics and is applying/developing software tools 
for the structured design of complex microsystems. Beside CAE-and ECAD-tools 
FEA-tools are very important for device- and (semiconductor) process modeling 
of microsystems like sensors and actuators. ANSYS will be applied in static, 
dynamic and piezoelectric problem solving. Also coupled field analysis (i.e. 
thermal induced stress, electro-magnetism, etc.) is gaining more and more 
importance in optimizing transducer/microsystem design. 

The FFMU will undertake some effort in developing such engineering software 
tools by itself and improve commercial software packages (ANSYS) for the 
special demand of microtechnics.
